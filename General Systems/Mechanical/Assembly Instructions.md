Full list of materials can be found under Bill of Materials

## Off the Shelf Components Required
- 1x TurtleBot 3
- 1x AMG8833 (IR Sensor)
- 1x JF-0530B (Solenoid Actuator)
- 1x L298N (Motor Driver)
- 2x FC-130A-13220 (DC Motor)
- 2x Wheels
- 1x Breadboard
- 4x M3x35mm spacers
- Various screws & nuts (see Bill of Materials)
- Various electrical components (see Electrical folder)

## 3D Printed Parts Required
Refer to CAD files (ver 3)  
- barrel.sldprt
- baseplate.sldprt
- bend(no gap).sldprt
- bend2.sldprt
- Lpiece_IRsensor.sldprt
- regulartube.sldprt (x2)
- solenoid holder.sldprt
- support1.sldprt
- support2.sldprt
- wheel2.sldprt (x2)

## Assembly Instructions
1. Procure parts & print 3D parts as above
2. Replace the rims of the wheels with the 3D printed part (wheel2.sldprt)
3. Assemble the parts as per CAD model (TurtleBot 3 may have to be dismantled temporarily)
4. Ensure that the barrel is facing vertically upwards & the balls are able to slide down the tube and into the barrel naturally before next step
5. Use superglue to connect pieces that are not connected by screws on the CAD model (e.g. bend2 to regular tube)

## Assembly Notes
- TurtleBot 3 waffle plates make it difficult to insert screws. If the screws are mounted at an angle, it is still functional
- support1.sldprt & support2.sldprt are designed to be slightly shorter than required. This difference allows the user to adjust the height of the pipe accordingly as there may be differences between CAD model and physical implementation. If the pipe is desired to be mounted higher, adding a piece of foam as a spacer can be done
- Superglue will cause discolouration on 3D printed parts. This is purely cosmetic defect. Can be painted over if desired
